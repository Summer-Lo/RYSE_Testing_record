Testing SmartBlind stability with different speed
- Top and bottom
	1. 100 speed with 80 cycles		[top_bottom_80_cycles_100_speed.csv]
	2. 80 speed with 80 cycles		[top_bottom_80_cycles_80_speed.csv]
	3. 50 speed with 80 cycles		[top_bottom_80_cycles_50_speed.csv]	---	FAILED (pulse counter failed and kept shifting)
	4. 70 speed with 80 cycles		[top_bottom_80_cycles_70_speed.csv]	---	Repo start goes wrong but not often (79th iteration the motor and gear disengaged, is fine)
